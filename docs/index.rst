Welcome to qdiv's documentation!
================================
qdiv is a python package for analyzing results from rRNA gene amplicon sequencing or similar data.

With qdiv you can subset and rarefy the data, generate a consensus table based on several count tables, 
calculate alpha- and beta diversity indices (focusing on Hill-based indices), 
plot a heatmap or PCoA, carry out null model analysis using Raup-Crick extended to Hill-based dissimilarity indices, 
and run the Mantel- and Permanova tests.
