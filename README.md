# qdiv

qdiv is a python package for analyzing results from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (or similar data).

With qdiv, you can subset the data, generate a consensus table based on several frequency tables, 
calculate alpha- and beta diversity indices (focusing on Hill-based indices), 
plot a heatmap or PCoA, carry out null model analysis using Raup-Crick extended to Hill-based dissimilarity indices, and do the Mantel test.

The documentation is available at https://qdiv.readthedocs.io

A compiled Windows-version of the program is available at omvatten.se/software.html
